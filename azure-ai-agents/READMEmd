# Example use case

```markdown
I would like to create a web app where a user can customize their interests by specifying following drop-down items:
- Select an industry (you can choose the most common 5 industries)
- Select a customer/company (you can pre-configure 10 most popular companies for each industry you choose above).
- Recency (you predefine, eg., last a month, last 3 months, last 6 months and 12 months)
- Free text box where a user can describe their interests. It could be related to the companies or industries.

Once the user provides information and select items, then the request will be handled by an Azure AI Agent which would handle the request. 

Please help with initial end to end implemnetation with python.
